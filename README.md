## Decision Making

As this being my first ever project to start from scratch in react I've used  [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
To setup my project.

First I've started writing the layout of the project by creating the main component.
Part of this was also to add the first call to the API in order to start using the data

After finishing with layout I've added Redux to the project.

Being done developing all the components I've started writing tests.
Usually I'm trying to use TDD/BDD as much as I can but as using React/Redux for the first time i've wanted to make sure I'm doing everything right.

For testing framework I've chose Jest and Enzyme.
Jest being something I've worked with before and also it's recommended by React creators(Facebook).
Enzyme was also recommended online for being an easy tool for lazy/full rendering of react component that benefited my tests and was easy to use.


## Bootstrap Instructions

before trying to start the project use `npm install` from the main directory.

in order to start the project building use `npm run` then navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the project.

in order to run the test suits use `npm test`.
